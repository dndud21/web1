  </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">How about this way, I love how you get cold when it's 62 degrees out. I love the way your mouth turns down just a little bit, right there,<br> I love how it takes you an hour a half to order a sandwitch.
    I even loved when you used my sweater for a kleenax.<br> I love it that after spending the day with you I can still smell your perfume on my clothes. I love how you're the last person<br>I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night.
    It took me eleven years to figure this out. And I came here tonight because when you realize you want to sepnd the rest of your life with someone,<br> you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible - Harry (When Harry Met Sally..., 1989)
