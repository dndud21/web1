    All I Want For Christmas Is You - Mariah Carey
    I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
    There is just one thing I need<br>
    I don't care about the presents<br>
    Underneath the Christmas tree<br>
    I just want you for my own<br>
    More than you could ever know<br>
    Make my wish come true oh<br>
    All I want for Christmas is you<br>
    I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
    There is just one thing I need, and I<br>
    Don't care about the presents<br>
    Underneath the Christmas tree<br>
    I don't need to hang my stocking<br>
    There upon the fireplace<br>
    Santa Claus won't make me happy<br>
    With a toy on Christmas day<br>
    I just want you for my own<br>
    More than you could ever know<br>
    Make my wish come true<br>
    All I want for Christmas is you<br>
    I won't ask for much this Christmas<br>
    I won't even wish for snow, and I<br>
    I just wanna keep on waiting<br>
    Underneath the mistletoe<br>
    I won't make a list and send it<br>
    To the North Pole for Saint Nick<br>
    I won't even stay awake<br>
    To hear those magic reindeer click<br>
    'Cause I just want you here tonight<br>
    Holding on to me so tight<br>
    What more can I do<br>
    Oh, Baby all I want for Christmas is you<br>
    All the lights are shining<br>
    So brightly everywhere<br>
    And the sound of children's<br>
    Laughter fills the air<br>
    And everyone is singing<br>
    I hear those sleigh bells ringing<br>
    Santa won't you bring me<br>
    The one I really need<br>
    Won't you please bring my baby to me quickly<br>
    I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
    This is all I'm asking for<br>
    I just wanna see my baby<br>
    Standing right outside my door<br>
    I just want you for my own<br>
    More than you could ever know<br>
    Make my wish come true<br>
    Baby all I want for Christmas is you<br>
    All I want for Christmas is you, baby<br>
